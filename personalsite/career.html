    <h2>Before Galvanize...</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/hermione.gif">
    <p>My professional background lies within the education field. For the last 4 years I have worked for EF High School Exchange Year and have helped run a high school foreign exchange program here in the United States. I have worked in Sales, Regulatory Compliance, Customer Service, and most recently on an events team running a summer orientation program for more than 2000 students in the NYC area. While I always enjoyed the mission of my company, I recently became bored and wanted a new opportunity to learn something new!</p>

    <h2>Attending Galvanize</h2>
    <p>I hope to work hard and learn as much as possible while here at Galvanize. I'm excited to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to learn how to design and build my own websites. Most importantly I am excited to learn from everyone in the class!</p>
